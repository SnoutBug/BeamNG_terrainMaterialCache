### **There is a Linux Port available, see [post on BeamNG.drive Forums](https://www.beamng.com/threads/86422/)** 

The port is experimental, I will therefore keep this repository online for the time being should any issues arise.

But please do give it a shot!

# Textures will load normally when using Proton Experimental Bleeding Edge. The steps below are no longer required if you can switch.

## [Manual] Usage (Steam - Proton)
### Default Maps
Please verify that this path exists BEFORE using the commands below

```Bash
~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/0.26/temp/art
```

```Bash
mkdir ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/0.26/temp/art
cd "$_"
url=github.com/SnoutBug/BeamNG_terrainMaterialCache/releases/download/default/
wget ${url}etk.tar.gz
wget ${url}jri.tar.gz
wget ${url}utah.tar.gz
wget ${url}derby.tar.gz
wget ${url}hirochi.tar.gz
wget ${url}industrial.tar.gz
wget ${url}gridmap_v2.tar.gz
wget ${url}small_island.tar.gz
wget ${url}east_coast_usa.tar.gz
ls *.tar.gz | xargs -n 1 tar -xvf
rm *.tar.gz
cd ~/
```

### BeamNG Repository (Mods)
 1. Look at the URL of your map (eg. www.beamng.com/resources/natural-playground.18030/)
 2. Copy the number behind the period (18030) to the following URL like this: www.github.com/SnoutBug/BeamNG_terrainMaterialCache/releases/tag/18030
 3. If the page exists, you will find a one-liner in the release's description which you can then use to downlad the textures

### Troubleshooting
 #### The above mentioned path did not exist
 1. Open your Steam Library and find BeamNG.drive
 2. Right Click > Manage > Browse Local Files
 3. Right Click > Open Terminal (or find a different way to do so)
 4. Use the following command
```Bash
mkdir ../../compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/0.26/temp/art
```
 5. If successful: Copy the all commands from [above](https://github.com/SnoutBug/BeamNG_terrainMaterialCache#default-maps) (**excluding** the first one)
 
 #### Running the Game with WINE
 1. Find the equivalent of: `%localappdata%\BeamNG.drive\0.26\temp\art\terrainMaterialCache`
 2. Modify the command below if need be
 ```Bash
 mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/users/$USER/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/0.26/temp/art
 ```
 4. If successful: Copy the all commands from [above](https://github.com/SnoutBug/BeamNG_terrainMaterialCache#default-maps) (**excluding** the first one)

 #### Running the game with CrossOver - Mac
 1. Select your Bottle towards the left of crossover
 2. Open advanced options and click on the Open C: drive button
 3. Finder will open, navigate to `/users/crossover/Local/AppData/BeamNG.drive/0.26/temp/art`
  - Should the `temp` or `art` folders not exist, create them.
 4. Once inside the `art` folder, open the Terminal [at the current location](https://www.maketecheasier.com/launch-terminal-current-folder-mac/)
 5. Use the commands [above](https://github.com/SnoutBug/BeamNG_terrainMaterialCache#default-maps) **excluding** the first two (`mkdir` and `cd`)
